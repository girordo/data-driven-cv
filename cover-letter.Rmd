I'm a front-end software engineer with over 6 years of experience across several types of business and a bioinformatics and functional programming enthusiast.

During my BSc in biomedical informatics I worked as a intern researcher in bioinformatics where I gained expertise in data analysis using R, more specifically ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, bioconductor packages(like limma and GEOQuery), and the creation of dashboards using Shiny
I had classes such as Algorithm and Data Structures, Object Orient Programming, Databases and SQL, Machine Learning, Operating Systems and Distributed Systems.
I also gained knowledge learning and using C, C++, R, Java and PostgreSQL.

At Spocket, I have had the privilege to work as a Frontend Engineer, utilizing React and its comprehensive ecosystem. I have contributed to the development of new features aligned with the company's coding standards and best practices. Notably, I have refactored legacy components to modern ES6+ standards, improving the maintainability and performance of the codebase. In addition, I created a guide for unit testing to facilitate effective collaboration within the team. My role also involved the successful implementation of a new CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions, AWS S3, and Cloudfront, resulting in streamlined deployment processes and improved efficiency.

My tenure at Dasa as a Software Engineer provided me with the opportunity to work extensively with React and associated technologies. I was responsible for developing new features, ensuring bug-free performance, and implementing refactoring strategies to enhance the design system's developer experience. My commitment to quality was demonstrated through the creation of a comprehensive unit testing suite, achieving an impressive 80% test coverage. Additionally, I spearheaded improvements to the CI/CD pipeline, leveraging Jenkins to enhance reliability and reduce processing time.

During my time as a Full Stack Engineer at Softwrap, I excelled in coordinating a dedicated team focused on crafting a seamless hybrid application using React Native and Firebase. Leading this team of 3 developers, I not only delivered on project goals but also nurtured the growth of junior team members through mentorship and guidance. One of my significant accomplishments was creating a pixel-perfect React Native application for the meticulous accounting needs of the firms, showcasing my dedication to precision and attention to detail.

In my previous role at SmartEnvios, I demonstrated my proficiency in a broader technology stack, handling full-stack development using React, Gatsby, TailwindCSS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Docker. I successfully contributed to the creation of the company's website, developed web scraping solutions, and implemented efficient deployment strategies.

As a dedicated learner, I continually invest time in expanding my skillset. Currently, I am learning Elixir and Phoenix to further enrich my programming capabilities. My holistic approach to development, collaborative spirit, and proactive problem-solving make me confident that I can contribute effectively to Belong ongoing success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your team's goals in more detail.
